# Localization of the Godot Engine editor

This repository contains the localization templates and catalogs for the
[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) editor, including the in-editor
class reference.

The translations are contributed through three projects on [Hosted
Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/):

- [godot](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot/):
  Strings from the editor interface.
- [godot-properties](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot-properties/):
  Strings extracted from property names and project/editor settings.
- [godot-class-reference](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot-class-reference/):
  Class reference for the Godot API.
